# Amacast

A decentralized AMA (Ask Me Anything) platform built on Optimism, integrating Farcaster social features with blockchain-based verification.

## Core Features

1. **AMA Discovery & Curation**

   - Browse featured AMAs from prominent Web3 figures
   - View curated Q&A matches ranked by usefulness
   - Stack multiple answers for comprehensive insights
   - Featured Q&As submitted on-chain for high-value content

2. **Profile Integration**

   - Farcaster profile integration with web3.bio data
   - View user's Q&A history and contributions
   - Track engagement metrics and match history
   - Display both IPFS-verified and on-chain featured Q&As

3. **Match Submission & IPFS Management**
   - Submit top 2 most useful Q&As to IPFS (verified submissions)
   - Submit single most valuable Q&A on-chain (featured submissions)
   - On-chain IPFS content mapping through IPCM
   - Track and verify IPFS content history through events
   - Support for multiple answers per question
   - Chronological display of submissions

## Architecture

### Storage Strategy

- **On-chain Storage**:
  - Featured Q&A pairs stored directly on-chain
  - IPFS content mapping through IPCM contract
  - Minimal storage using Merkle roots for regular submissions
  - Event-based history tracking for content updates
- **Off-chain Storage**:
  - IPFS via Pinata for regular match data and content
  - Content-addressed storage with version history
- **Verification**:
  - Merkle proofs for efficient data verification
  - IPFS content integrity through CIDs
- **Security**:
  - ECDSA signatures for data authenticity
  - Owner-controlled IPFS content updates

### Key Components

1. **Smart Contracts**

   - `AMAContract`: Core AMA functionality and user profiles
   - `AMAMatcher`: Optimized match submission and verification system
   - `AMARegistry`: Registry of AMAs and their creators
   - `AMAFeatured`: On-chain storage for featured Q&A submissions
   - `AMAIPCM`: On-chain IPFS content mapping and history

2. **Off-chain Storage (IPFS/Pinata)**

   - Regular question-answer pairs
   - Match submissions with version control
   - User metadata and profile data
   - Content history through IPFS CIDs

3. **Frontend**
   - Next.js application with TypeScript
   - RainbowKit for wallet connection
   - Farcaster integration for social features
   - Web3.bio integration for profile data
   - IPFS content history viewer

## Project Structure

This project consists of three main components:

1. **Web Application (`/amacaster/`)**
   - Main web interface for the AMA platform
   - Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
   - Handles user interactions and AMA management

2. **Farcaster Frame (`/amacast/`)**
   - Farcaster Frame implementation
   - Uses Farcaster Frame SDK for frame-specific features
   - Provides embedded AMA experience within Farcaster

3. **Core App (`/app/`)**
   - Shared business logic and hooks
   - Smart contract interactions
   - IPFS content management
   - Data models and utilities

## Contract Addresses (Optimism Sepolia)

- AMAFeatured: `0xA78d4FcDaee13A11c11AEaD7f3a68CD15E8CB722`
- AMARegistry: [Address]
- AMAMatcher: [Address]
- AMAContract: [Address]
- AMAIPCM: `0x86D7cD141775f866403161974fB941F39F4C38Ef`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Yarn or npm
- Optimism Sepolia testnet access
- Pinata API credentials
- Neynar API key for Farcaster integration

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy example env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Fill in required values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=your_gateway_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_AMA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155420  # Optimism Sepolia
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your_neynar_client_id
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_key
```

- `NEYNAR_API_KEY` is **server-only** and should NOT be exposed to the client.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID` is safe for the client and used for OAuth flows.


### Installation and Development

This is the main web application for the AMA platform.

### Installation and Development

```bash
# From the root directory
npm install

# Run development server (default: http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

### Note on Farcaster Frame Implementation
The Farcaster Frame implementation is maintained in a separate repository. For frame development and testing, please refer to the frame-specific repository and documentation.

#### Environment Setup
- Make sure to set up the appropriate environment variables in `.env.local`
- The web application requires Neynar API keys for Farcaster integration

### Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
cd contracts
yarn install
yarn compile
yarn deploy:optimism
```

## Refactor Roadmap: Farcaster Integration

- Audit current Farcaster/Neynar API usage: replace direct REST calls with `@neynar/nodejs-sdk` for consistency and type safety.
- Identify privileged actions requiring API key (e.g., posting casts, user auth) and move them to backend Next.js API routes under `/pages/api`.
- Create server-side endpoints (e.g., `/api/fetchCast`, `/api/fetchThread`, `/api/authUser`) using secure environment variable `NEYNAR_API_KEY` (no client exposure).
- Refactor frontend hooks (`useAMA`, `useNeynarUser`, etc.) to call new backend endpoints instead of direct SDK or fetch calls.
- Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_API_KEY` from client `.env.local`; configure only `NEYNAR_API_KEY` on server environment.
- Leverage the active Neynar MCP server:
  - Use `mcp search` to find SDK examples and official docs.
  - Prompt MCP to scaffold API routes and generate integration tests.

## Neynar MCP Server Setup

The Neynar MCP server enables AI-powered development, documentation lookup, and code generation for Farcaster/Neynar integrations.

### How to Use

1. **Install MCP (if not already):**
   - Clone the [Mintlify MCP repo](https://github.com/mintlify/mcp) or use the prebuilt Neynar MCP server.
2. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   node ~/.mcp/neynar/src/index.js
   ```
   - You should see: `MCP Server running on stdio`
3. **Integration with Cascade:**
   - Cascade will automatically use the MCP server for documentation search, code generation, and integration test scaffolding.
   - Use prompts like:
     - `mcp search <query>` to find SDK usage examples
     - `mcp doc <endpoint>` to read endpoint docs
     - `mcp test <api>` to scaffold integration tests

### Tips
- Keep the MCP server running in the background during development.
- Use MCP to ensure youâ€™re using the latest Neynar SDK features and best practices.

- Add automated tests for each API route and key Farcaster workflows (e.g., Jest or React Testing Library).
- Update documentation, code comments, and examples to reflect the new backend-driven architecture.
